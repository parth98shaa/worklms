              The practice of Yoga has been around for decades and recently become a trending exercise used by many worldwide to promote a better lifestyle. To be precise, Yoga is actually an ancient Indian practice that involves physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines that are intertwined into a beneficial healing experience.

                <h3><span>01</span> What is the Yoga process?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>The yoga process is a system of physical and mental exercises that are designed to promote health and well-being. The word “Yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word Yuj, which means “to yoke” or “to unite.” The practice of yoga is said to yoke the body and mind and promote a sense of harmony and balance in the individual. There are many different types of yoga, but all share the same basic principles. Physical exercises, or asanas, are designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles and joints and promote flexibility and balance. The mental exercises, or pranayama, are designed to calm and focus the mind and promote a sense of inner peace and well-being.</p>

                  <p>There are many variations of yoga poses, so if you can’t do one, try another until you find one that works for you. Stick to your own pace and do what feels right. This practice is meant to help you mentally, physically, and emotionally so don’t worry about everyone else and focus on your breathing and technique. </p>

                  <p>Yoga injuries are typically due to overstretching or repetitive strain. To avoid injury, be sure to warm up before yoga class and listen to your body. A quick stretch before the start of a Yoga class is always a good idea!</p>
