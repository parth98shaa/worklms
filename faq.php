                <h3> How is yoga different from stretching, or other kinds of fitness?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>The practice of yoga is more than just physically moving your body.  Within the physical practice you connect movements to the breath, which helps to focus and relax your mind.  In a yoga class, you are asked to bring your awareness to the present moment - to focus on the here and now - using your body and breath as an anchor.  This enhances your self-awareness so in time you start to notice more about how your body moves and what feels good or not so good.  Yoga also asks you to be OK with what is, without judgment. Just because you aren’t as flexible as someone else, or not as flexible as you used to be, doesn’t mean you aren’t “good at yoga”.  Over time you take these learnings off the mat and start to practice these concepts in your life as well.  As the postures improve your strength and flexibility, yoga also improves your mental health and overall well-being. </p>

                <h3>Can I practice yoga while menstruating?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>I hate to say it again, but it depends.  Some women prefer to pause their practice while menstruating while others continue practicing. I would suggest that you slow down your practice during your heavy flow days.  On those days you only have so much energy to give and should not deplete yourself from practicing yoga.  There is a lot of research out there on this specific topic, but again, my answer is to do what feels best for you.     </p>

                <h3>Should I wait to eat before practicing the poses?  Or should I wait to eat after?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>In general, I would say eat at least 2 hours before practicing the poses.  Of course it’s fine to eat something small if you need the nourishment to get through a class.  Just don’t practice the poses on a full stomach.  After practice, I would suggest waiting 15-30 minutes to eat.  This just gives your body time to move away from the physical practice and get ready to digest.  </p>

                <h3>How do I know if I’m doing it right? </h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>Before I dive into this one, it’s important to say that everyone’s bodies and bone structure are all very different, so there isn’t just one “right” way to do a pose. It’s about finding out what works for your own body.  Developing this body awareness takes practice. As long as something doesn’t hurt, you are probably ok.  You’ll definitely experience different sensations and feel your muscles working, but if you feel any type of “warning” pain, such as sharpness or pinching, make sure to listen to your body and come out of the pose slowly.</p>
